# AI Python Stock Price Predictor UI
## Intro
This repo is designed to be an easy-to-understand project that implements machine learning. Inspired by [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuZY9q-aKLw&t=126s&ab_channel=NeuralNine) video, I learned a tremendous amount about AI/ML fundamentals -- epochs, neural networks, data training, etc.  

This program "predicts" the closing stock price of a user-selected stock. The user inputs a ticker symbol (found on Yahoo Finance) and the number of epochs used for the program and the UI block returns the price of a selected stock the following day.

### Setup
1 - Clone the master repository (git clone https://github.com/Nate-Fish/AI_Python_Stock_Price_Predictor_GUI.git)

2 - Open up your cloned repository's directory and type npm install to download all dependencies (numpy, pandas, tkinter, tensorflow)

When you run this file, you should see the following:

## Tutorial
1. Enter a ticker symbol that can be found on Yahoo Finance
2. Select the number of epochs you would like to use. Remember that the more epochs you select, the longer the program will take

## Status
